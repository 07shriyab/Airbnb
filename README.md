<p align="center"> What are the most signifcant factors influencing Airbnb prices in London? </p>

## Executive Summary 

## Motivation
Airbnb has become a disruptor in the market for property rentals thus and has thus become a relatively easy way for people to earn extra income through investing in new properties and renting them out via Airbnb. Guests often find Airbnbs to be cheaper and tend to prefer them over hotels due to the ‘homier’ feel. As Airbnb rapidly expands with thousands of new listings being added everyday, we wanted to find out what type of properties a host should invest in and what features they should include in order to make the most rental revenue and to retain customers.
