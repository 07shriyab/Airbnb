<p align="center"> What are the most signifcant factors influencing Airbnb prices in London? </p>

## Executive Summary 
Having reported more than 100 million bookings in the first quarter of 2022, the Airbnb business has resurged from the pandemic and is booming. ‘Air Bed and Breakfast’ or Airbnb is essentially an online marketplace whereby those who wish to rent out their property are connected to people who are searching for accommodation when visiting that location. Airbnb has over 5.6 million listings across 220 countries globally and 100,000 locations. Some of its main competitors include Booking.com, TUI and Tripadvisor. 
Living in London ourselves, the key question we wanted to consider is what causes the prices of the hundreds of listings in London to fluctuate.

Above we see that a rental request for 4 adults in London for 3 nights brings about 2 significantly different results in terms of price per night. So what drives these variations? To help us answer this question, we extracted 66,000 of London’s listings from InsideAirbnb and used them to analyse the features a listing possessed and its effect on its price. We investigated features such as location, amenities and property type to identify possible correlation between these features and the listing’s price. We then extracted over 1 million reviews to understand the sentiment behind the most expensive listings. Furthermore, London is a world city as it is home to some of the best universities and it hosts a variety of international financial services thus there is high demand for property in this city. This also means that there is high competition for rental properties and small variations in price can make a significant difference in demand for the listing. If the price is too high, people will not be willing to pay and if the price is too low, the owners are losing potential income. Therefore through this project we used machine learning and regression analysis to help predict the base price for rental properties in London. 
Through the use of tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Python to analyse and visualise our data, we found that there is some correlation with prices and the factors we have chosen to investigate (location, Wifi), while some don’t seem to have any trend (availability 365). Also, we have learned how to use Natural Processing Language to analyse comments (unstructured textual data)  which will be helpful for the hosts to understand each  guest’s activities, opinions and feedback to successfully derive their rental services. Furthermore, we learnt that predicting prices with Random Forest Regression is better compared to other selected machine learning regression models. However, we have to keep in mind that there are price outliers in the listings data, making machine learning a bit inefficient. 
Overall, we recognized the listings and reviews data is not perfect because the lead time at which they were gathered was 9th September 2021. Therefore, the factors may have a different relationship with the price today than the price from September. However, we see machine learning and python libraries have given the importance of reviews and price prediction to hosts and guests. This will encourage more research for the data analyst to help hosts to see if their Airbnb price could be sensitive to the change of such factors observed. 
Finally, we were able to put together a list of recommendations to prospective guests and hosts in order to make the most value out of their next property rental. Two examples of these include:
1. Location is an important factor that affects prices - the most expensive boroughs are in the centre of London (Kensington, Chelsea, City of London, Westminster) 
2. Top amenities an aspiring host should include: Wifi, smoke alarm, essentials, heating, long term stay allowed

## Motivation
Airbnb has become a disruptor in the market for property rentals thus and has thus become a relatively easy way for people to earn extra income through investing in new properties and renting them out via Airbnb. Guests often find Airbnbs to be cheaper and tend to prefer them over hotels due to the ‘homier’ feel. As Airbnb rapidly expands with thousands of new listings being added everyday, we wanted to find out what type of properties a host should invest in and what features they should include in order to make the most rental revenue and to retain customers.
